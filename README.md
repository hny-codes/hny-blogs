## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a personal blog while trying out [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/). Creating this project allowed me to learn more about content management systems (CMS) and get familiar with using one. In addition, this project allowed me to practice creating websites utilizing the Astro framework and the power behind it, such as built-in pagination and dynamic routes.

## Setup
