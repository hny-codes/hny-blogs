## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a personal blog while trying out [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/). Creating this project allowed me to learn more about content management systems (CMS) and get familiar with using one. 

In addition, this project allowed me to practice creating websites utilizing the Astro framework and the power behind it, such as built-in pagination and dynamic routes.

## Built with
- Typescript
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Swup](https://swup.js.org/)
- [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
- [Prismjs](https://prismjs.com/)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

All blog posts and most assets are stored on the Contentful Content platform. Blog posts are first written in Markdown, then rendered utilizing [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), a markdown parser. 

## Setup

Upon cloning this repo, install it using your preferred package manager, like so: 

`$ npm install`

Afterwards, run the project in dev mode:

`$ npm run dev`

and that's it!
